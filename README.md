# questioner
Crowd-source questions for a meetup. Questioner helps the meetup organizer prioritize questions to be answered. Other users can vote on asked questions and they bubble to the top or bottom of the log.

The App is hosted on github-pages [ here ](https://mchardex.github.io/questioner/).


The endpoints are hosted on heroku [ here ](https://questioner-mchardex.herokuapp.com/api/v1/welcome).
